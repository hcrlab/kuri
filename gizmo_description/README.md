# gizmo_description

A subset of the description package from Mayfield's Kuri. Doesn't include the URDF's for the many prototype robots.

A more accurate model of the robot's sensors is included but disabled by default because it renders
navigation unusable. This better represents the real robot's performance, though, so you can elect to use it by replacing the original file with it.
